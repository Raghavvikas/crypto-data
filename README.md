# crypto-data

### Note :: I have tried my best to run this project. But won't able to show the Line Graph which I think I could be. 
Two major reasons for this, first, Shortage of time cause I am a Full time employee only have 3-4 hours, second, have'nt have any experience with React-Graph.

## Flow of the Project

APP.js ==> Home.js ==> NavBar.js ==> CryptoTabs.js ==> MultiLineGraph.js

# OverView

==> ""App.js""  uses React Router library to switch
==> uses Hooks LIKE ""useState useEffect"" 
==> ""Home.js"" ==> takes up the data from the API and pass filtered it Using ARRAY-Filter Method so that Tabs Could be render according to ""TAGS"" Category
    ==> Passed data to CryptoTabs and NavBar.
   
==> NavBar ==> render the Categories top of the Window

==> CryptoTabs ==> render data into the box shape architechure shows all the required items of a particular crypto coin.

==> MultiLineGraph ==> whenever clicking on any of the box it should render the Line Graph with Name of the Coin o the top. """"""ERROR""""""


###Conclusion ==>  Thankyou for this assignment because this utilises many of the REACT & JAVASCRIPT logics.
                  On the Same side I regret for not able to render the LINE GRAPH.
